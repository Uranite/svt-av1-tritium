 * mc_denoise_glue.h — encoder integration of the motion-compensated
 * temporal denoiser (see mc_denoise.h for the algorithm modules).
 *
 * The glue owns one state object per encoder instance, hung off the shared
 * EncodeContext (SCS objects are struct-copied by the pipeline, EncodeContext
 * is not). The state buffers copies of the most recent input pictures and
 * delays the release of PictureParentControlSets into the Picture Analysis
 * kernel until enough temporal neighbours have arrived (or end of stream is
 * signalled), denoises them, and writes the result back into the pcs input
 * buffers before the regular PA body runs.
